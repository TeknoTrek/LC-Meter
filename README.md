# DIY LC Meter Project

This project demonstrates how to build a DIY LC Meter capable of measuring inductance (L) and capacitance (C) values using an Arduino Nano, an LM311 comparator, and a 16x2 LCD display. The LC Meter is designed to be simple, affordable, and effective for electronics enthusiasts and DIY hobbyists. It is suitable for learning about measurement principles while also being a practical tool.

## Project Highlights:

### 1 - Circuit Schematic
A detailed circuit diagram explains the working principle and interconnection of components such as the LM311 comparator, relay, calibration buttons, and measurement probes. The schematic provides a foundation for assembling the hardware.

### 2 - PCB Design
A professionally designed single-layer PCB created with KiCad ensures clean routing and minimizes interference. It includes detailed silkscreen labels for easy assembly and debugging.

### 3 - 3D Model
A realistic 3D representation of the completed PCB with components mounted, offering a clear view of the final product and component placement.

### 4 - Firmware
The Arduino Nano is programmed with custom firmware to calculate inductance and capacitance values. Measurements are displayed on a 16x2 LCD in real time.

### 5 - Calibration and Functionality
The project includes functionality for calibration, zeroing, and easy measurement. Buttons on the PCB allow users to fine-tune settings for accurate results.

### Features:
- Precise Measurements: Measure a wide range of inductance and capacitance values.
- User-Friendly Interface: Includes a 16x2 LCD display for real-time measurement results and intuitive feedback.
- Adjustable Calibration: Easily calibrate the device for accurate readings using the on-board calibration buttons.
- Compact and Portable: The design is compact, making it easy to use in different workspaces or carry for fieldwork.


### Instructions:
### Prepare the PCB:
Download the provided Gerber files and manufacture the PCB, or use the KiCad design to etch your own board.

### Assemble Components:
Place and solder all components as per the silkscreen labels on the PCB.

### Upload Firmware:
Use the Arduino IDE to upload the provided sketch to your Arduino Nano. Ensure all libraries are correctly installed.

### Power and Calibration:
Connect the LC Meter to a 5V power source via USB or the provided input terminals. Calibrate the device using the calibration and zero buttons for precise results.

### Start Measuring:
Connect your inductors or capacitors to the respective terminals (Lx or Cx) and observe the measurement results on the LCD.
